# Release Please automates releases using Conventional Commit messages. After each release it maintains an open PR
# called `chore(main): release <semver>`, which keeps the CHANGELOG.md up to date along with a changelog.json file.
# When the release PR is merged, this action will create a Github release. Our docs-site PR workflow will use the
# contents of the changelog.json file and PR headers to generate release notes for the public docs website.
# See https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action
