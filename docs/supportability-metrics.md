# Supportability Metrics
---
## What/Why
Supportability metrics are intended to be used to give internal value through analysis of patterns, typically by occurrence or by value.

## How
A timeslice metric is harvested to the JSE/XHR consumer. An aggregation service called Angler aggregates metrics against known labels once per hour and reports a new event with the aggregation findings to a dedicated account.

### Logging
<!--- Logging harvest was too big to send --->
* Logging/Harvest/Failed/Seen
<!--- Logging harvest was sent before the interval elapsed --->
* Logging/Harvest/Early/Seen

### Session
<!--- Session has ended due to max time limit reached --->
* Session/Expired/Seen
<!--- Session has ended due to inactivity time limit reached --->
* Session/Inactive/Seen
<!--- Duration of Session at time of ending --->
* Session/Duration/Ms
<!--- Capture SMs for Session trace if active (ptid is setwhen returned byReplay ingest). Retain these SMs while we are working through the Session_replay Feature --->
* PageSession/Feature/SessionTrace/Duration/Ms

### AJAX
<!--- Ajax Events were Excluded because they matched the Agent beacon --->
* Ajax/Events/Excluded/Agent
<!--- Ajax metrics were Excluded because they matched the Agent beacon --->
* Ajax/Metrics/Excluded/Agent
<!--- Ajax Events were Excluded because they matched the Customer deny list --->
* Ajax/Events/Excluded/App
<!--- Ajax metrics were Excluded because they matched the Customer deny list --->
