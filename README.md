# New Relic Browser Agent

The New Relic browser agent instruments your web application or site and provides observability into performance, errors, and other behaviors.

- The instructions on this page pertain to installing the browser agent as an NPM package (currently in pre-release).

- The browser agent is also generally available as a copy-paste JavaScript snippet and via auto-injection by backend apps. See *[Install the browser agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/)* for info on these alternatives.

- For questions and feedback on this pre-release package, please visit the [Explorer's Hub](https://forum.newrelic.com/s/), New Relic's community support forum.

- Looking to contribute to the browser agent code base? See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) for instructions on building and testing the browser agent library, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for general guidance.

## Adding the agent package to your project

To make the agent available to your application, install via [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/install/).

```shell
$ npm install @newrelic/browser-agent --save
```

```shell
$ yarn add @newrelic/browser-agent
```

## Creating an app in New Relic One

Before instrumenting your app using the NPM package, a Browser App should be configured in New Relic One. This may be done with or without a corresponding APM agent. Once the app has been created, the Copy/Paste JavaScript code on the app's *Application settings* page will contain the configuration values needed to define options when instantiating the agent via the NPM package.

1. If a browser app does not already exist, create one:
   - From the *New Relic One* navigation panel, click *Add Data*.
   - Select the *Browser monitoring* data source.
   - Choose the *APM* or *Copy/Paste* method.
   - Select or name your app and click *Enable*.
2. From the navigation panel, select *Browser* to view brower apps.
3. Select the desired app and navigate to the *Application settings* page.
4. From the *Copy/Paste JavaScript* box, copy the configuration values assigned to the `NREUM` object (`init`, `info`, and `loader_config`). You will use these configuration values when instantiating the agent using the NPM package.

## Instantiating the agent

For best results, import and instantiate the `BrowserAgent` class as close to the top of the `head` element of your app's HTML output as possible. The specific location and method will vary based on your application's architecture or framework.

Populate the `options` parameter using configuration values found in the the *Copy/Paste JavaScript* box in your browser app's *Application settings* page in New Relic One.

```javascript
import { BrowserAgent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/loaders/browser-agent'

// Populate using values in copy-paste JavaScript snippet.
const options = {
  init: { ... }, // NREUM.init
  info: { ... }, // NREUM.info
  loader_config: { ...} // NREUM.loader_config
}

// The agent loader code executes immediately on instantiation.
new BrowserAgent(options)
```

## Turning off features at runtime

Features may be turned off at runtime, which may have a meaningful peformance impact in some cases.

In the example below, the `page_view_timing` and `session_trace` features are disabled.

```javascript
const options = {
  info: { ... },
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: {
    page_view_timing: { enabled: false },
    session_trace: { enabled: false },
    ...
  }
}
```

The following features may be disabled by adding `init` entries as shown above. Note that the `page_view_event` feature may not be disabled.

- `ajax`
- `jserrors`
- `metrics`
- `page_action`
- `page_view_timing`
- `session_trace`
- `spa`

See the [New Relic documentation site](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring/) for information on the above features.


## Composing a custom agent with selected feature modules

The examples above use the `BrowserAgent` class, which is the best option for most use cases. The class makes all browser agent features available but provides the ability to turn off individual features selectively.

Using the base `Agent` class, it is also possible to compose a custom agent by passing an array called `features` in the `options` object, containing only the desired feature modules. Depending on which features are included, this may yield a smaller loader script and improved performance.

The example below includes three feature modules: `Metrics`, `PageViewEvent`, and `PageViewTiming`.

```javascript
import { Agent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/loaders/agent'
import { Metrics } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/metrics'
import { PageViewEvent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/page_view_event'
import { PageViewTiming } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/page_view_timing'

const options = {
  info: { ... },
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: { ... }
}

new Agent({
  ...options,
  features: [
    Metrics,
    PageViewEvent,
    PageViewTiming
  ]
})
```

The following feature modules are available for inclusion in the `features` array:

```javascript
import { Ajax } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/ajax';
import { JSErrors } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/jserrors';
import { Metrics } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/metrics';
import { PageAction } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/page_action';
import { PageViewEvent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/page_view_event';
import { PageViewTiming } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/page_view_timing';
import { SessionTrace } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/session_trace';
import { Spa } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/spa';
```

## Supported Browsers

Our supported browser list can be accessed [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types).

If you desire more control over how the agent is built, our package also includes the source code. The source code is written to target the latest ECMAScript standards (ES2022). Please note that if you import the browser agent source code instead of the transpiled distribution code, you may need to alter your project's build system to apply transformations to the browser agent source code. Without these transforms, the code produced by your project's build system may not be compatible with your desired target browsers. Below is an example of how to import the source code.

```javascript
// Note the /src/ in the import paths below
import { Agent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/src/loaders/agent'
import { Metrics } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/src/features/metrics'
import { PageViewEvent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/src/features/page_view_event'
import { PageViewTiming } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/src/features/page_view_timing'

const options = {
  info: { ... },
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: { ... }
}

new Agent({
  ...options,
  features: [
    Metrics,
    PageViewEvent,
    PageViewTiming
  ]
})
```

Neither the browser agent development team nor the New Relic support teams can support the numerous build systems that exist in the JavaScript ecosystem. If you run into issues, you may be asked to revert to importing from the transpiled distribution code.

**DON'T** mix imports between the browser agent source code and transpiled distribution code. The below will break.

```javascript
// THIS IS BAD - do not do this
import { Agent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/loaders/agent'
import { Metrics } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/src/features/metrics'
```
