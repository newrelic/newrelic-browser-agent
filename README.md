# New Relic Browser Agent

The New Relic browser agent instruments your web application or site and provides observability into performance, errors, and other behaviors.

- The instructions on this page pertain to installing the browser agent as an NPM package.

- The browser agent is also generally available as a copy-paste JavaScript snippet and via auto-injection by backend apps. See *[Install the browser agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/)* for info on these alternatives. Releases are deployed to customers gradually, so the version available via these other methods often lags the current release of this package.

- For questions and feedback on this package, please visit the [Explorer's Hub](https://forum.newrelic.com/s/), New Relic's community support forum.

- Looking to contribute to the browser agent code base? See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) for instructions on building and testing the browser agent library, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for general guidance.

## Adding the agent package to your project

To make the agent available to your application, install via [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/install/).

```shell
$ npm install @newrelic/browser-agent --save
```

```shell
$ yarn add @newrelic/browser-agent
```

## Creating an app in New Relic

Before instrumenting your app using the NPM package, a Browser App should be configured in New Relic. This may be done with or without a corresponding APM agent. Once the app has been created, the Copy/Paste JavaScript code on the app's *Application settings* page will contain the configuration values needed to define options when instantiating the agent via the NPM package.

1. If a browser app does not already exist, create one:
   - From the *New Relic* navigation panel, click *Add Data*.
   - Select the *Browser monitoring* data source.
   - Choose the *APM* or *Copy/Paste* method.
   - Select or name your app and click *Enable*.
2. From the navigation panel, select *Browser* to view browser apps.
3. Select the desired app and navigate to the *Application settings* page.
4. From the *Copy/Paste JavaScript* box, copy the configuration values assigned to the `NREUM` object (`init`, `info`, and `loader_config`). You will use these configuration values when instantiating the agent using the NPM package.

## Instantiating the agent

For best results, import and instantiate the `BrowserAgent` class as close to the top of the `head` element of your app's HTML output as possible. The specific location and method will vary based on your application's architecture or framework. See [Library Support](#library-support) for more information.

Populate the `options` parameter using configuration values found in the the *Copy/Paste JavaScript* box in your browser app's *Application settings* page in New Relic.

```javascript
import { BrowserAgent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/loaders/browser-agent'

// Populate using values in copy-paste JavaScript snippet.
const options = {
  init: { ... }, // NREUM.init
  info: { ... }, // NREUM.info
  loader_config: { ...} // NREUM.loader_config
}

// The agent loader code executes immediately on instantiation.
new BrowserAgent(options)
```

## Turning off features at runtime

Features may be turned off at runtime, which may have a meaningful peformance impact in some cases.

In the example below, the `page_view_timing` and `session_trace` features are disabled.

```javascript
const options = {
  info: { ... },
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: {
    page_view_timing: { enabled: false },
    session_trace: { enabled: false },
    ...
  }
}
```

The following features may be disabled by adding `init` entries as shown above. Note that the `page_view_event` feature may not be disabled.

- `ajax`
- `generic_events`
- `jserrors`
- `logging`
- `metrics`
- `page_view_timing`
- `session_replay`
- `session_trace`
- `soft_navigations`
- `spa`

***Individual event types within the `generic_events` feature can also be disabled. See [Disabling Individual Generic Events](#disabling-individual-generic-events)***

See the [New Relic documentation site](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring/) for information on the above features.

### Disabling Individual Generic Events
The following event types reported by the `generic_events` feature can be individually disabled in the `init` configuration.

#### Page Actions
```javascript
const options = {
  info: { ... },
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: {
    page_action: {enabled: false}
    ...
  }
}
```

#### User Actions
```javascript
const options = {
  info: { ... },
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: {
    user_actions: {enabled: false}
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Performance (Marks, Measures, Resources)
```javascript
const options = {
  info: { ... },
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: {
    performance: {
      capture_marks: false, // disable performance mark collection
      capture_measures: false, // disable performance measure collection
      resources: {
        enabled: false // disable performance resource collection
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

## Options Parameter

The `options` parameter used, or passed in, when instantiating the `BrowserAgent` class can include the following arguments:

| Argument       | Type     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `info`         | Object   | Operational information for the agent. `applicationID` and `licenseKey` properties are strictly required to be defined inside of this. Some properties may be provided by APM-injection installation. See model object in [info.js](src/common/config/info.js). |
| `init`         | Object   | (Optional) Initialization settings for the agent, including feature toggles. This controls many parts of the agent's behavior and that of its features. It's recommended to understand each config being changed before doing so. See the object returned by `model()` in [init.js](src/common/config/init.js). |
| `loader_config`| Object   | (Optional) Agent installed via APM-injection is provided this object by the APM agent. It's highly recommended to leave this alone. Defaults to model object in [loader-config.js](src/common/config/loader-config.js). |
| `runtime`      | Object   | (Optional) Used by the agent to store shared references or info at runtime. It's highly recommended to leave this alone. Defaults to model object in [runtime.js](src/common/config/runtime.js). |
| `exposed`      | Boolean  | (Optional) Affects whether the `newrelic` API includes or acts on this agent. If set to false, for example, `newrelic.setCustomAttribute()` would not affect this agent instance. Defaults to true. |

The underlying `Agent` class `options` parameter also includes the following _additional_ arguments, as shown in the next section:

| Argument       | Type     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `features`     | Array    | List of feature classes to be used by the agent. This determines what features _can_ actually be enabled and affects your bundler build size of the agent. `PageViewEvent` is forcibly included, even if it's not in this array or an empty array is passed in. |

## Composing a custom agent with selected feature modules

The examples above use the `BrowserAgent` class, which is the best option for most use cases. The class makes all browser agent features available but provides the ability to turn off individual features selectively.

Using the base `Agent` class, it is also possible to compose a custom agent by passing an array called `features` in the `options` object, containing only the desired feature modules. Depending on which features are included, this may yield a smaller loader script and improved performance.

The following feature modules are available for inclusion in the `features` array:

```javascript
import { Ajax } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/ajax';
import { GenericEvents } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/generic_events';
import { JSErrors } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/jserrors';
import { Logging } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/logging';
import { Metrics } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/metrics';
import { PageViewEvent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/page_view_event';
import { PageViewTiming } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/page_view_timing';
import { SessionReplay } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/session_replay';
import { SessionTrace } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/session_trace';
import { SoftNav } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/soft_navigations';
import { Spa } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/spa';
```

### Example 1 - "Page Load Agent"
The example below includes three feature modules: `Metrics`, `PageViewEvent`, and `PageViewTiming`.

```javascript
import { Agent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/loaders/agent'
import { Metrics } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/metrics'
import { PageViewEvent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/page_view_event'
import { PageViewTiming } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/page_view_timing'

const options = {
  info: { ... },
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: { ... }
}

new Agent({
  ...options,
  features: [
    Metrics,
    PageViewEvent,
    PageViewTiming
  ]
})
```

### Example 2: "Custom Events Agent"
The example below builds an agent that only allows custom events (`.recordCustomEvent(...)`) and does not automatically detect any other event types besides a PageView event (required). It also [disables the automatic collection of certain generic events](#disabling-individual-generic-events) to ensure only manual events are captured.

```javascript
import { Agent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/loaders/agent'
import { GenericEvents } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/features/generic_events';

const options = {
  info: { ... },
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: { 
    // disable the automatic collection of UserAction events
    user_actions: {enabled: false},
    // disable the automatic collection of BrowserPerformance events
    performance: {
      capture_marks: false,
      capture_measures: false,
      resources: {enabled: false}
    }
  }
}

const browserAgent = new Agent({
  ...options,
  features: [
    GenericEvents
  ]
})

// manually capture page actions
browserAgent.addPageAction(...)
// manually capture custom events
browserAgent.recordCustomEvent(...)
```

## Deploying one or more "micro" agents per page

The examples above use the `Agent` class at their core, which is ideal for most cases as it will automatically detect page-level events across your web application.

Using the `MicroAgent` class, it is possible to skip the "auto" instrumentation phases of the other loader types, and provide a *very small* agent designed for capturing data in a controlled manner via the API interfaces. The `MicroAgent` captures a distinct `PageView` event when instantiated, and additional `PageAction` and `JavaScriptError` events may be captured by calling the `noticeError` and `addPageAction` methods.

Because it does not wrap the page-level globals in the same way as the base `Agent` class, the `MicroAgent` is not only smaller but can easily be instantiated multiple times on a single page with low overhead, with each instance configured to report to a different Browser App entity in New Relic if desired. This accommodates specialized use cases, such as segmented UI designs (e.g., the micro front-end pattern) or applications requiring subsets of manually-handled data to be reported to different application entities.

The example below illustrates how to instantiate and interact with two separate `MicroAgent` instances on one page.

```javascript
import { MicroAgent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/loaders/micro-agent'

const options_1 = {
  info: { ... }, // configuration for application 1
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: { ... }
}

const microAgent1 = new MicroAgent(options_1)

const options_2 = {
  info: { ... }, // configuration for application 2
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: { ... }
}

const microAgent2 = new MicroAgent(options_2)

// manually handle a JavaScript Error with microAgent1
try{
  ...
} catch(err) {
  microAgent1.noticeError(err)
}

// manually capture a Page Action with microAgent2
microAgent2.addPageAction('myData', {hello: 'world'})
```

## Browser Agent APIs
All Browser Agent APIs are exposed for use in two ways:
- Via the `newrelic` window-level global object
- At the top-level of the Agent instance

Please see our [official documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/using-browser-apis/) for more information about the Browser Agent APIs.

```js
  newrelic.noticeError(...)
  // or
  const NrAgent = new BrowserAgent(...)
  NrAgent.noticeError(...)
```

## Session Replay
The Session Replay feature is now available for limited free use by all customers. The data collected by this feature will become billable starting May 15th, 2024. Please see the [Session Replay documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/browser-pro-features/session-replay/) to get started using this new feature.

## Supported browsers

Our supported browser list can be accessed [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring/#browser-types).

If you desire more control over how the agent is built, our package also includes the source code. The source code is written to target the latest ECMAScript standards (ES2022). Please note that if you import the browser agent source code instead of the transpiled distribution code, you may need to alter your project's build system to apply transformations to the browser agent source code. Without these transforms, the code produced by your project's build system may not be compatible with your desired target browsers. Below is an example of how to import the source code.

```javascript
// Note the /src/ in the import paths below
import { Agent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/src/loaders/agent'
import { Metrics } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/src/features/metrics'
import { PageViewEvent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/src/features/page_view_event'
import { PageViewTiming } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/src/features/page_view_timing'

const options = {
  info: { ... },
  loader_config: { ... },
  init: { ... }
}

new Agent({
  ...options,
  features: [
    Metrics,
    PageViewEvent,
    PageViewTiming
  ]
})
```

Neither the browser agent development team nor the New Relic support teams can support the numerous build systems that exist in the JavaScript ecosystem. If you run into issues, you may be asked to revert to importing from the transpiled distribution code.

**DON'T** mix imports between the browser agent source code and transpiled distribution code. The below will break.

```javascript
// THIS IS BAD - do not do this
import { Agent } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/loaders/agent'
import { Metrics } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/src/features/metrics'
```

## Bundling
As an outcome of the design patterns employed in the browser agent package, building the agent can generate lazy-loaded chunks for many of the utilized modules. To concatenate, deduplicate and reduce those modules to a single lazy-loaded file the same way we do internally when shipping to our CDN, you can choose to utilize the `"build-tools"` directory which includes rulesets for various build tools.  

**Please note - This is an optional step.  The browser agent can be built without any rules instructing the build tools about the handling of the lazy-loaded chunks, or the chunks can be handled in any way you see fit to conform to your build process. This ruleset serves as an example of what we do internally when shipping to our CDN.**

### Webpack
For Webpack (v4+), you can choose to use our [webpack cache group rule](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-browser-agent/blob/main/tools/bundler-tools/bundler-tools.mjs) to instruct webpack on how to handle the agent's lazy chunks. The cacheGroup rule acts as a rule within the [SplitChunksPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/). Please observe the relevant documentation for use of this plugin. The output of this cache group rule will generate a lazy aggregate module, and lazy chunks for session replay, which matches the pattern found on our CDN distribution. 

### Other
Plugins for other bundling tools are planned for the future.

```javascript
// in webpack.config.js
const { webpackCacheGroup } = require('@newrelic/browser-agent/tools/bundler-tools')
// ... or ...
import { webpackCacheGroup } from '@newrelic/browser-agent/tools/bundler-tools'

{
  // ... 
  optimization: {
      splitChunks: {
        cacheGroups: {
          // A ruleset for handling the browser agent modules
          ...webpackCacheGroup(), 
          // ... other cache groups
        }
      }
    },
  // ... 
}
```

## Library Support

The browser agent is written to be agnostic to any JavaScript library or framework. The agent exposes a number of [API methods](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-apis/using-browser-apis/) that can be incorporated into libraries and frameworks. For example, export or make available the initialized agent and create a new error boundary in your react application that calls `browserAgent.noticeError()`.

### Server-Side Rendering

A lot of new frameworks support the concept of server-side rendering the pages of an application to improve SEO and the performance of the user experience. The browser agent must be imported and instantiated within a browser context and will not work if executed on a server or in the server context of a server-side rendered application. These frameworks typically provide support for defining code that should only be run on the client. Check your frameworks documentation for more information.

## Disclaimers

* The session replay feature is not turned on by default. For information on the use of this feature, see [Session Replay](#session-replay)
* As part of the improvement efforts around our SPA capabilities, the `createTracer` API has been [deprecated](https://docs.newrelic.com/eol/2024/04/eol-04-24-24-createtracer/). Please engage in removing usage of that library. If tracking task duration, we recommend utilizing the generic browser performance mark and measure APIs, which will gain native detection support from the agent in a future update.
