# WebView Specs

These spec files are meant to be ran against a test mobile application containing a webview. The app used is owned by the mobile teams. Below are build instructions if we ever need to update the app in LambdaTest.

The apps are stored here under `assets` for posterity.

## Writing Tests

Tests wrote against a native app cannot use a lot of the custom commands and features we have built into WDIO. You will need to access the `driver` global directly and reference the [Appium documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/appium).

You may also want to use the SauceLabs specific [Appium inspector app](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector) to run the test app. This allows you to get information like selector strings for targeting elements.

## Building iOS Test App

- Clone the ios agent repository
- Switch to the branch needed if necessary
- Run `git submodule update --checkout --recursive` to pull latest submodules
- Open a terminal and CD into the project directory
- Run `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` to ensure your local xcode tools are setup correctly
- Run `xcodebuild ARCHS=x86_64 clean build -workspace Agent.xcworkspace -scheme NRTestApp -derivedDataPath './nrba-build' -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 13 Pro Max,OS=15.5' -configuration Release CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` to build the NRTestApp
  - You may need to install the 15.5 iOS sdk
- CD into `nrba-build/Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator`
- Run `zip -r NRTestApp.zip NRTestApp.app`
- You can now open this directory in Finder and drag/drop the zip into the Real Time -> Virtual Mobile screen of LambdaTest

## Building Android App

- Use [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) or some other means to install Java 11
- Clone `https://github.com/ndesai-newrelic/Android-WebView`
- Open the project in android studio
- Make sure you have API level 28 installed
- Create a new file called `local.properties` and add `sdk.dir=/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk` to it replacing `<username>` with your home directory name
- Open `java/com/webview/myapplication/MainActivity.java`
- Comment out the code requesting storage access permissions and the code supporting downloads from the webview.
- Open `settings.gradle` and change the app name to `nr-test-app`
- Open `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and change the name of the app to `NRTestApp`
- Open the `build` menu and select build APKs
- Open finder to the location of the APK file and drag/drop the zip into the Real Time -> Virtual Mobile screen of LambdaTest
