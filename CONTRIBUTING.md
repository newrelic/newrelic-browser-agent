### General Guidelines

This project is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license. Any third party libraries added as dependencies of the project must have a similarly permissive open source license, e.g. MIT.

### Coding Style Guidelines/Conventions

All code should follow [![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

We use eslint to enforce our style.  To lint your code, you can run `npm run lint` on the
command line.  There are plugins available for most editors (see
[eslint's documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors)
for more details).

## Testing

All changes to the Agent should include test coverage, and each PR must pass
all tests against all browsers in LambdaTest locally before being merged.

We run tests on a variety of browsers and platforms to ensure that the agent runs safely for all users. We use LambdaTest.

When you first submit your PR, the tests will not be run automatically. After we review the PR, we will add a label that will trigger the full-matrix testing.

See [Running Tests](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-browser-agent#running-tests)
for more details on how to run tests locally.

## Review

PR Review should look at both code changes, and architectural decisions. A
reviewer should ensure that all of the following are true before approving a
change:

* Both the code and the architectural decisions have been thoroughly reviewed
and understood by another member of the team.
* The changes have passed all tests against all browsers in SauceLabs.
* All code changes in the agent have been covered by new tests.
* Appropriate documentation changes have been made (where applicable).
* Extraneous commits have been squashed.
* Commit message are concise.
* The [change log]('./CHANGELOG.md') has been updated (where applicable).
